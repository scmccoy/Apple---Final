Mosquito Byte! is a citizen science project to collect data around the United States in an effort to track the rate and location of mosquito bites. 

The app is simple. When you get bit by a mosquitoes, simply open the app and press the "I've been bitten" button. Make sure your phone is Wifi enables and able to send data. 

Pressing the button will send our server 2 pieces of information:
Your Geolocation (approx. within 100m) & the date. 
We do not receive or ask for any other information. 

We recommend using the app no more than once an hour, in the event of getting bit by a mosquito. 

We will use these data in a visual mapping service to allow scientists and the public to track mosquito bites in the United States.
