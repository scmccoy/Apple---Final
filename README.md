# Mosquito Byte! App

A citizen science app built for [Vector Ecology](http://vectorecology.org/outreach/mosquito-bite-app/).

The goal: Allow users to notify researchers of when they get bitten by a mosquito. By opening app and pressing 'I've been bitten' button, the gps coordinates and timestamp are sent to our database. 
The data is added to our mapping service to show users current data of app users.
